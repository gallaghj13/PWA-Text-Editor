# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a text editor that meets the requirements of a Progressive Web Application(PWA). It is a single page application that runs in the browser. The app features different data persistence techniques in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. Another cool feature of this app is that it functions offline.
